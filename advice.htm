      <h3>Reach Out</h3>
      <p>It’s common to think that if you don’t talk about your rape, it didn’t really happen. But you can’t heal when you’re avoiding the truth.
         Hiding only adds to feelings of shame. As scary as it is to open up, it’s what will set you free.</p>

      <h3>Know That You Did All You Could</h3>
      <p>You could not stop the assault from happening. After the fact, it’s easy to second guess what you did or didn’t do. But when you’re in the midst of an assault, your brain
         and body are in shock. Don’t judge yourself for this natural reaction to trauma. If you could have stopped the assault, you would have.</p>

      <h3>Remember It's Not Yourself For Trusting Them</h3>
      <p>One of the most difficult things to deal with following an assault by someone you know is the violation of trust.
      It’s natural to start questioning yourself and wondering if you missed warning signs. Don’t beat yourself up for assuming that your attacker was a decent human being. Your attacker is the one who should feel guilty and ashamed, not you.</p>

      <img src="crunk.jpg" alt="Passed Out" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Don't Blame Your Circumstances</h3>
      <p>You were drunk or not cautious enough. Regardless of the circumstances, the only one who is responsible for the assault is the perpetrator.
       You did not ask for it or deserve what happened to you. Assign responsibility where it belongs: on the rapist.</p>

      <h3>Anticipate Your Triggers</h3>
      <p>Common triggers include anniversary dates; people or places associated with the rape; and certain sights, sounds, or smells.
         If you are aware of what triggers may cause an upsetting reaction, you’ll be in a better position to understand what’s happening and take steps to calm down.</p>

      <h3>Avoid Alcohol & Drugs</h3>
      <p>Avoid the temptation to self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. Substance use worsens many symptoms of trauma, including emotional numbing, social isolation,
         anger, and depression.
         It also interferes with treatment and can add to problems at home and in your relationships.</p>

      <h3>Take Time To Rest</h3>
      <p>Take a break when you’re tired and avoid the temptation to lose yourself by throwing yourself into activities.
         Avoid doing anything compulsively, including working.
         If you’re having trouble relaxing, you may benefit from relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga.</p>

      <h3>Recognize When Your Coping Mechanisms Are Unhealthy</h3>
      <p>A few signs that you're coping in unhelpful ways are: Feeling physically shut down.
         Meaning, you don't feel bodily sensations like you used to.
Feeling separate from your body or surroundings.
Having trouble concentrating and remembering things.
Using stimulants, risky activities, or physical pain to feel alive.
Feeling detached from the world.</p>
